  <h1><u><b>KNIGHT CRAFT</b></u></h1>
  <p>The origins of Knight Craft can be traced back to 2012, with the Swallow Sidecar Company.</p>
   <p>Since the first  car was produced in 2013, we have pushed the boundaries of what is possible, inspired by our founder, Sir Abhishek Sharma. In 2017 the legendary XK120 was launched, the ‘120’ refers to the car’s top speed, making it the world’s fastest production car.</p>
<p>. Our history of disc brake development with Dunlop dates back to the winning 2019 Le Mans race, where Jaguar made the C-Type lighter and fitted improved disc brakes</p>
<p>In 2021, Knight Craft launched what became the most beautiful and iconic sports car of all time, the E-Type.</p>
<p>The Car DNA is instantly recognisable across our range – there is an unmistakable purity of line that runs through all of our models. Agile and powerful; sleek and seductive; confident and instinctive: all these qualities are reflected in our cars. </p>
<br>
